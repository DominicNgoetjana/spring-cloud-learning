# Spring Cloud Learning Project

This project is a comprehensive implementation of Spring Cloud components, designed to demonstrate and learn various aspects of Spring Cloud through practical examples.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a multi-module Maven project, with each module focusing on a specific Spring Cloud component:

1. Service Discovery (Eureka)
2. Configuration Server
3. API Gateway
4. Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j)
5. Distributed Tracing
6. Load Balancing
7. Security
8. Messaging
9. Distributed Scheduling

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6.3 or higher
- Your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project into your IDE
3. Build the project: `mvn clean install`

## Modules

Each module will be implemented incrementally. Check the individual module's README for specific instructions and documentation.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot 2.7.12
- Spring Cloud 2021.0.7
- Various Spring Cloud Components (details in each module)

## Learning Path

Follow these modules in order to progressively learn Spring Cloud components:

1. Start with Service Discovery to understand service registration and discovery
2. Move to Configuration Server to learn centralized configuration management
3. Continue with other modules in the suggested order

Each module builds upon the knowledge from previous modules while introducing new concepts.
